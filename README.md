# Predicting-Stock-Prices-using-Deep-Learning
Stock prices are affected by countless factors and some of these include company performance, economic conditions, news events, and investor sentiment. This complexity makes perfect prediction impossible, but machine learning can help identify patterns humans might miss. 


In this project, I ingested and engineered two years of daily OHLCV records (via yfinance) for NVIDIA and built three deep learning models - RNN, CNN, and LSTM - to predict stock prices. I evaluated the performance of each model by calculating MSE and visualizing validation loss.

Key takeaway: blending complementary deep learning architectures reduces forecast risk and extracts richer signals for data-driven trading strategy design.
