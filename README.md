# Predicting-Stock-Prices-using-Deep-Learning
In this project, I ingested and engineered two years of daily OHLCV records (via yfinance) for NVIDIA and built three deep learning models - RNN, CNN, and LSTM - to predict stock prices. I evaluated the performance of each model by calculating MSE and visualizing validation loss.
